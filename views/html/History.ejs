<h2 >Early years (1878-1945)</h2>
<p>Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[17] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ green and gold ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they were defeated 6ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[18] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name.[17] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[17]</p>

<h2>Busby years (1945-1969)</h2>
<p> In October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[25] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[26] They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed "the Busby Babes" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.[27] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[28] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.[29]</p>

<h2 >Ferguson years (1986-2013)</h2>
<p> Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[42] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[43] Despite a second-place finish in 1987ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“88, the club was back in 11th place the following season.[44] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“3 draw) saved Ferguson's career.[45][46] The following season, Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners' Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup, beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“0 at Wembley.[41] In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ alongside the FA Cup ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to complete the first "Double" in the club's history.[41] United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“96,[47] before retaining the league title once more in 1996ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“97 with a game to spare.[48]</p>

<h2 >2013-present</h2>

<p>On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[64][65] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[66][67][68] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“96.[69] They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990.[70] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[71] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[72]

Although Van Gaal's first season saw United once again qualify for the Champions League through a fourth-place finish in the Premier League, his second season saw United go out of the same tournament in the group stage. </p>

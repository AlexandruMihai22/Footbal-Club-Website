<h2 id="A">Club America</h2>
<p>Manchester United kicked off Tour 2018, presented by Aon, with a 1-1 draw against Club America as Lee Grant made an impressive debut for the Reds in Phoenix.

The Mexican side took the lead on the hour mark thanks to a bullet header from Henry Martin, but Juan Mata ensured a share of the spoils for Jose MourinhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s men in the first match of pre-season.

It was a lively start from both sides and Anthony Martial was unlucky not to receive a penalty on nine minutes after he appeared to be tripped in the area, but American official Kevin Stott was unmoved. </p>

<h2 id="L">Leicester city</h2>
<p>Pogba stepped up and, after a typically nonchalant slow run-up, placed the ball in the top-right corner above Kasper Schmeichel.

Left-back Luke Shaw then scored the first senior goal of his career after controlling Juan Mata's aerial pass to double their lead.

Substitute Jamie Vardy headed a late consolation for Leicester after Ricardo Perreira's cross had hit a post, and Foxes goalkeeper Schmeichel came forward for an injury-time corner but his header went wide.

Pogba lasted 84 minutes before being replaced by Marouane Fellaini, but Mourinho said he did not expect the Frenchman to play for so long.

"Pogba was a monster," said the United boss. "We thought maximum 60 minutes but he managed over 80.

"The decision belonged to Paul. I asked him and he made himself available and he was very good."</p>

<h2 id="B">Burnley</h2>
<p>Romelu Lukaku scored twice in the first half as the Red Devils - beaten by Brighton and Tottenham in their previous two Premier League matches - were largely untroubled by their hosts.

Pogba had the chance to stretch United's lead midway through the second half but his penalty - after Aaron Lennon fouled Rashford - was saved by former Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart.</p>

<h2 id="BH">Brighton</h2>
<p>Lukaku headed in a first-half cross from Nemanja Matic, who sealed victory late on when he nodded in Ashley Young's free-kick.

Victory maintained realistic United hopes of a trophy after Tuesday's Champions League elimination by Sevilla, as well as their record of not having conceded a goal in this season's FA Cup.

But Jose Mourinho's side struggled through the second half, as Brighton had several chances to force extra-time before Matic finally put the tie to bed.

'I blame everybody' - Mourinho complains his side were 'scared to play'
Home fans, angry about the unadventurous performance in defeat by Sevilla, became increasingly tetchy as the game wore on.

Jurgen Locadia, Brighton's Ã‚Â£14m record signing, had four chances to equalise, with goalkeeper Sergio Romero saving the first two before the Dutchman headed over wastefully from Solly March's cross.

He then had a shot blocked by Chris Smalling, who had hit the post for United before Lukaku's goal.</p>
